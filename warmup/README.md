## Warmup - Trick Or Treat

Write code to make the tests pass in the following sequence:

* `spec/candy_spec.rb`
* `spec/bag_spec.rb`
* `spec/costume_spec.rb`
* `spec/trick_or_treater_spec.rb`

Run a test file by calling it with `rspec`:

```bash
$ rspec spec/candy_spec.rb
```

Unskip tests by removing `xit` and replacing it with `it`. Only unskip and work on **one** test at a time!
